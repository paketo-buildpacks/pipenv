# Pipenv Cloud Native Buildpack
The Paketo Pipenv Buildpack is a Cloud Native Buildpack that installs
[pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv) into a layer and makes it available
on the `PATH`.

The buildpack is published for consumption at `gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/pipenv`.

## Behavior
This buildpack always participates.

The buildpack will do the following:
* At build time:
  - Contributes the `pipenv` binary to a layer
  - Prepends the `pipenv` layer to the `PYTHONPATH`
  - Adds the newly installed pipenv location to `PATH`
* At run time:
  - Does nothing

## Configuration
| Environment Variable | Description
| -------------------- | -----------
| `$BP_PIPENV_VERSION` | Configure the version of pipenv to install. Buildpack releases (and the supported pipenv versions for each release) can be found [here](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/pipenv/releases).

## Integration

The Pipenv CNB provides pipenv as a dependency. Downstream buildpacks, can
require the pipenv dependency by generating a [Build Plan
TOML](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/master/buildpack.md#build-plan-toml)
file that looks like the following:

```toml
[[requires]]

  # The name of the Pipenv dependency is "pipenv". This value is considered
  # part of the public API for the buildpack and will not change without a plan
  # for deprecation.
  name = "pipenv"

  # The version of the Pipenv dependency is not required. In the case it
  # is not specified, the buildpack will provide the default version, which can
  # be seen in the buildpack.toml file.
  # If you wish to request a specific version, the buildpack supports
  # specifying a semver constraint in the form of "2018.*", "2018.11.*", or even
  # "2018.11.26".
  version = "2018.11.26"

  # The Pipenv buildpack supports some non-required metadata options.
  [requires.metadata]

    # Setting the build flag to true will ensure that the Pipenv
    # depdendency is available on the $PATH for subsequent buildpacks during
    # their build phase. If you are writing a buildpack that needs to run Pipenv
    # during its build process, this flag should be set to true.
    build = true

    # Setting the launch flag to true will ensure that the Pipenv
    # dependency is available on the $PATH for the running application. If you are
    # writing an application that needs to run Pipenv at runtime, this flag should
    # be set to true.
    launch = true
```

## Limitations

This buildpack requires internet connectivity to install `pipenv`. Installation
in an air-gapped environment is not supported.

The dependency URL metadata contained in `buildpack.toml` is not actually used,
as `pipenv` is installed directly from the internet. However, the rest of the
depedency metadata is used (e.g. for generating an SBOM). This will be
addressed in upcoming work which will change the way dependencies are consumed
by buildpacks.

## Usage

To package this buildpack for consumption:
```
$ ./scripts/package.sh --version x.x.x
```
This will create a `buildpackage.cnb` file under the build directory which you
can use to build your app as follows: `pack build <app-name> -p <path-to-app> -b <cpython-buildpack> -b <pip-buildpack> -b build/buildpackage.cnb -b <some-pipenv-consumer-buildpack>`.

To run the unit and integration tests for this buildpack:
```
$ ./scripts/unit.sh && ./scripts/integration.sh
```
